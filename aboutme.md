The past few years I´m learning and using powershell a lot - and get passioned for it. The most I used it, more I found my self in love for it!

The objective here it´s to bring the most possible technics and tecnologies that I´m using to share, in the most explaintive way.

My interest subjects are:
- task automation
- multi-plattaform integration
- get things done
- make my life easyer
- share all the knowlage I can
